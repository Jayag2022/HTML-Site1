  <h4>About Us</h4>
  <p>God told Joshua that where ever the sole of his feet trod, 
    he would posses. We have faith that as we travel and pray 
    in agreement, weâ€™re taking territories back for Christ, 
    spreading the revival fire of the Holy Ghost and restoring 
    unity in the body.</p>
